# Extended-Binary-Search-Tree
This is a project for the "Estruturas de Dados BÃ¡sicas II" course from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN).

<b>This Binary Search Tree has the following operations:</b>

1. inserir()
    > Inserts new element in the tree.
    
2. remover()
    > Removes element from the tree.
    
3. procurar()
    > Searches for element in the tree. Returns true if element is found.
    
4. enesimoElemento(int n)
    > Returns n-th element of the tree when traversed in-order.

5. posicao(Object object)
    > Returns the position of the objects in the tree en traversed in-order.
    
6. mediana()
    > Returns the element that would be in the middle position in an ordered array that contains all elements of the tree.

7. ehCheia()
    > Returns true if all leaf nodes are in the last or second to last levels of the tree.

8. ehCompleta()
    > Returns true if all leaf nodes are in the last level of the tree and all other nodes have two children.

9. toString()
    > Return string containing all elements in level order traversal.

<br>Running the program:</b>

1. Go to src folder and type... 
    > javac Driver.java No.java -d ../bin
    
2. Go to bin folder and type...
    > java Driver
    
3. Select the files, go to data folder and select entrada.txt or entrada2.txt and then select the instrucoes.txt.

4. The program is now running.
